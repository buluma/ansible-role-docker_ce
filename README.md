## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from `molecule/default/converge.yml` and is tested on each push, pull request and release.
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - role: buluma.docker_ce
      docker_ce_privileged_users:
        - woody
        - buzz
```

The machine needs to be prepared. In CI this is done using `molecule/default/prepare.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: Prepare
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  become: yes

  roles:
    - role: buluma.bootstrap
    - role: buluma.epel
    - role: buluma.buildtools
    - role: buluma.python_pip
    - role: buluma.core_dependencies

  tasks:
    - name: Create test case users
      ansible.builtin.user:
        name: "{{ user }}"
      loop:
        - woody
        - buzz
      loop_control:
        loop_var: user
```


## [Role Variables](#role-variables)

The default values for the variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```yaml
---
# defaults file for docker_ce

# Add users to the privileged docker group. For example:
# docker_ce_privileged_users:
#  - UserA
#  - UserB
docker_ce_privileged_users: []
```
